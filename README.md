# Fine-Tuning for DevOps
A document to give insights about how fine tuning techniques can be applied to DevOps process and operations.


## Vocabulary

1. **Transfer Learning**

Transfer learning refer to a technique where the knowledge gained from one task is applied to a different but related task. This involves using a pre-trained model and adapting it to the new task with a smaller dataset.

2. **Pre-trained Models**

Pre-trained models are models that have been trained on large, general corpora. These models have learned general features and representations that can be useful for a wide range of tasks. Ex :
- Language models for speech generation : OpenAI's GPT models, Meta's Llama models, MistralAI's Mixtral models
- Diffusion models for image generation : OpenAI's DALL-E family, StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion family, Black Forest Labs Flux family
- Vision models for image interpretation : YOLO, SAM, Dino

3. **Domain-Specific Datasets**

Fine-tuning requires a smaller dataset that conveys the specific knowledge, style, tasks, or use cases of the domain learned. The creation of the dataset for Fine-Tuning is the most important aspect of it given that neural networks are a high-level approximation of a dataset (not correlated to the neural network architecture used - [see universal approximation theorem](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/1/4/425/5503/Learning-in-Artificial-Neural-Networks-A)) 

## What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is the idea of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a domain-specific dataset. This process allows the model to specialize in the new task while retaining the general knowledge it acquired during pretraining.

## Why Fine-Tune a Model?


1. **Cost and Resource Efficiency**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model is generally much faster, more cost-effective, and more compute-efficient than training a model from scratch. 

2. **Better Performance on Narrow Use Cases**: Fine-tuned pre-trained models, with their combination of broad foundational learning and task-specific training, can achieve high performance in specialized use cases.

3. **Adapting to New Data**: Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to new data while retaining the general knowledge it acquired during pretraining. This is particularly useful when the new data differs significantly from the original data.

## How to Fine-Tune a Model

1. **Select a Pre-trained Model**: Choose a pre-trained model that is well-suited to your task. This model should have been trained on a large, general dataset and should have learned features and representations that are relevant to your task.

2. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Create a smaller, domain-specific dataset that conveys the specific knowledge, style, tasks, or use cases for which you want to fine-tune the model. This dataset should be much smaller than the original dataset used to train the pre-trained model.

3. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Train the pre-trained model on your domain-specific dataset. This involves adjusting the model's parameters to better fit the new data. 

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset to ensure that it has learned the new task effectively. You may need to iterate and do trial/error for your fine-tuning strategy to achieve optimal results.

## Mathematical Concepts

Fine-Tuning is an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem)

1. **Loss Function**: The loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. The goal of fine-tuning is to minimize the loss function.

2. **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. It involves adjusting the model's parameters in the direction that reduces the loss.

## Preparing the Dataset

Preparing the dataset is a crucial step in fine-tuning a model for DevOps languages like Ansible, AWS CDK, vCenter, etc. The dataset should be:

1. Domain-Specific: The dataset should convey the specific knowledge, style, tasks, or use cases related to DevOps languages. This includes configurations, playbooks, infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, and other relevant DevOps artifacts.

2. Balanced: The dataset should be balanced to ensure that the model does not become biased towards certain DevOps tools or tasks. It should include a diverse range of examples from different DevOps languages and use cases.

3. Clean: The dataset should be clean and free of errors to ensure that the model learns the correct features and representations. This includes syntax errors, misconfigurations, and outdated practices.

## Dataset structure

The task is to generate and understand domain-specific knowledge. The dataset for Fine-Tuning an LLM should be a three-dimensionnal tensor :

- axis 1 : Batch size - How many examples we have
- axis 2 : 2 here - Question / Answer
- axis 3 : The dimension of the embeddings library for the machine - The sentences for a human
